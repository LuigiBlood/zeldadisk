Custom Zelda Ocarina of Time Disk Assembly Source

This is a custom Zelda Ocarina of Time Expansion Disk Proof of Concept.

ARM9's bass fork is needed for it to assemble.

Just assemble EZLJ_DISK_Main.asm to assemble the whole disk file together as SDK format.
By default, the disk file produced is a retail disk for the japanese version of Zelda Ocarina of Time.
Define "USA" for a disk compatible with the american version, and define "DEV" for a development disk.
